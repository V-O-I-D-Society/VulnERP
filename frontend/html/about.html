        <h1>Welcome to VulnERP</h1>
        <p class="subtext">
            A deliberately vulnerable college ERP environment for
            practical security testing and learning.

            <h3>Platform Objective</h3>
            <p>
                VulnERP helps learners identify real-world security
                weaknesses commonly found in enterprise applications,
                particularly in authentication and user input handling.
            </p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Previous Screen Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                The initial login page relied entirely on client-side logic.
                This was intentional and demonstrates why frontend-based
                security controls should never be trusted.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>How Challenges Work</h3>
            <p>
                Not all vulnerabilities appear after login. Some issues may
                exist earlier in the workflow, even before role-based access
                is granted.
            </p>

    <!-- HINT -->
    <div class="hint-box">
        <strong>Note:</strong> This is not a game that always begins after
        clicking a start button. Observe how data is processed on each page —
        sometimes the vulnerability is already in front of you.
